## Stage 1
Write a program that reads two integer numbers from the same line and prints their sum in the standard output. Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

## Stage 2
Write a program that reads two numbers in a loop and prints the sum in the standard output. If a user enters only a single number, the program should print the same number. If a user enters an empty line, the program should ignore it.

When the command `/exit` is entered, the program must print `Bye!`, and then stop.

## Stage 3
At this stage, the program should read an unlimited sequence of numbers from the standard input and calculate their sum. Also, add a `/help` command to print some information about the program. If you encounter an empty line, do not output anything.
